This is going to be a tutorial on how to make the set ups to be able to use stripe.

Now i have a mac, and thats all i know how to use so i am unsure how one would do this on windows

first you need to make sure you have the following installed in your virtual env
stripe
python-decouple 
(if you have brew, the last one can be installed with the following command:
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
)

the next thing you are going to need is the keys, if youd like them message me personally
(me being Noah or Wanless in discord)
and i can send them to you securily
but assuming you have them, make sure you have them set as env varsiables on your machine with the names:
'stripe_test_api_secret_key'
and
'stripe_webhook_secret_key'

then that should be the main bits of set up and transactions should work

#NOTE#
the webhook will NOT work, because that would require me logining into my stripe account on everyones comupters, and thats too much work at the moment
